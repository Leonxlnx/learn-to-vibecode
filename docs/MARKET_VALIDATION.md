## 📊 THE PROBLEM: Traditional Coding Education is Broken

### Statistics on Developer Learning

**Learning Curve is Steep**
- 69% of developers are self-taught (Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023)
- Average time to become job-ready: 6-12 months of intensive learning
- 73% of bootcamp graduates spend $10,000+ on their education
- Only 20% of coding bootcamp graduates find jobs within 6 months

**High Dropout Rates**
- Online coding courses have 90%+ dropout rates (MIT Study, 2019)
- Codecademy reported only 5% of users complete a full course
- Udemy courses: average completion rate is 13%
- YouTube tutorials: 97% never finish what they start

**Time is the #1 Barrier**
- 89% cite "lack of time" as main reason for not learning (HackerRank)
- Average developer has only 5 hours/week for learning
- Traditional courses require 300-500 hours to become proficient

## 💡 THE OPPORTUNITY: Education Gap

### No One is Teaching Vibecoding Properly

**Current State**
- Most AI coding tutorials: "Here's how to use ChatGPT for code"
- Focus on the tool, not the methodology
- No structured curriculum exists
- No gamification or engagement
- No community or support

**Search Demand** (Google Trends, Ahrefs)
- "learn coding with AI": +340% search growth YoY
- "AI coding tutorial": 90,000 monthly searches
- "Cursor IDE tutorial": 40,000 monthly searches
- "vibecoding": Emerging term with rapid growth
- "prompt engineering for coding": 22,000 monthly searches

**What Developers Actually Need**
1. Understanding AI's capabilities and limitations
2. Effective prompting strategies for code generation
3. Review and debugging AI-generated code
4. Architecture and system design with AI
5. Best practices for AI-assisted workflows
