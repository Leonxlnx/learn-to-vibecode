## 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Have for Demo

### Execution & Completeness
- [ ] **Fix any console errors** - Clean browser console
- [ ] **Test all navigation flows** - Every link works
- [ ] **Onboarding → Dashboard flow** - Smooth, no bugs
- [ ] **Course module completion** - ViobeCoins actually save and persist
- [ ] **Mobile responsive** - Test on phone, fix breakpoints
- [ ] **Chatbot actually works** - Test BYOK with real API key

### Design Polish
- [ ] **Loading states everywhere** - No sudden pops
- [ ] **Consistent border-radius** - All rounded-2xl or rounded-3xl
- [ ] **Hover states** - Every clickable element has feedback
- [ ] **Empty states** - What shows when no data?

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY - Strong Demo

### Features to Complete
- [ ] **DashboardHome content** - Not empty, show first module preview
- [ ] **Projects page** - At least 3 project templates, not "Coming Soon"
- [ ] **Progress persistence** - Save completed chapters to Supabase (not just localStorage)
- [ ] **User avatar/initials** - Show in header next to ViobeCoins

### UX Improvements
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation** - Tab through course, Enter to expand
- [ ] **Progress indicator on course** - Visual bar showing overall completion
- [ ] **Celebration animation** - When completing a chapter
- [ ] **Sound effects** - Optional subtle sounds for completion

### Content
- [ ] **All 10 modules have real content** - No placeholder text
- [ ] **Each chapter has 5+ paragraphs** - Substantial learning
- [ ] **Pro tips are actually useful** - Not generic
- [ ] **Tasks are specific and doable** - Actionable

## 🟢 NICE TO HAVE - Impressive Extras

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **AI-generated personalized tips** - Based on user progress
- [ ] **Streak counter** - Days in a row learning
- [ ] **Leaderboard** - Compare with other learners (mock data ok)
- [ ] **Certificate generator** - PDF on course completion
- [ ] **Share progress on Twitter** - Social proof

### Design Wow-Factor
- [ ] **Animated logo** - Subtle pulse or glow
- [ ] **Page transitions** - Smooth fade between routes
- [ ] **Particle effects** - Subtle background particles
- [ ] **Dark/Light mode** - Even if just dark, make it toggle-able
- [ ] **Custom cursor** - On hover over interactive elements

### Community
- [ ] **Discord widget** - Live member count
- [ ] **Testimonials** - Even if mock, show social proof
- [ ] **Founder video** - 30-second intro embedded

## 🔵 SECURITY & PRODUCTION

### Must Fix
- [ ] **No API keys in client code** - Check all files
- [ ] **Supabase RLS enabled** - Row Level Security on all tables
- [ ] **Input sanitization** - XSS protection on user inputs
- [ ] **Rate limiting thoughts** - Document approach even if not implemented

### Best Practices
- [ ] **Error boundaries** - Catch React errors gracefully
- [ ] **404 page** - Custom not found page
- [ ] **SEO meta tags** - Title, description on all pages
- [ ] **Favicon correct** - Shows in browser tab
- [ ] **Open Graph tags** - For social sharing
